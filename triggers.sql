-- TODO FOR SAAD
--     ____________CHANGES TO BE  MADE_________________
--          "make the report more detailed communicate with the student, "            
--          "mention their name in reporting"
--          "for example: XYZ here is your test report"
--          "report the students score compared to every other"
--          "add messages (encouraging, or imporvements)"




-- Create a trigger that would insert into recommendations table
-- understand the below conditional
-- IF highest_score >= 0.85 AND highest_score <= 0.99 THEN
        --     SET v_current_level = 'Advanced';
        -- ELSEIF highest_score >= 0.50 AND highest_score < 0.85 THEN
        --     SET v_current_level = 'Intermediate';
        -- ELSEIF highest_score < 0.50 THEN
        --     SET v_current_level = 'Beginner';
        -- END IF;
-- Now in report that is of type text consider the mention the following :
    -- student's average score (no of subjects/ sum of all score in all subjects)
    -- student's best subject
    -- recommended departments(check scores in different subjects) to do this.
        -- FOR example if the student scored best in subjects "Computer Science", "Matematics", "Engineering Design" ,
        -- "physics" than recommed departments like physics, computer science, mathematics
        
-- Lastly remember that this report is a column in recommendations table, and this is a TEXT type, you will need to
-- concatinate TEXT to from a report
-- you have free hand to add anything meaning full you'd like to the report.
